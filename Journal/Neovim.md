## Plugins and things I want

## LSP

How did [beginbot](https://twitch.tv/beginbot) get the weird cube instead of regular LSP error sign?

##

What plugin does `teej_dv` use to display that enter sign at the end of every line? (`\n`)

Got it! It is cyclist.vim.

## Cool keybindings

`o` and capital o makes insert in new line down and O is for editing a new line up

Capital J is to join lines in Visual Mode
