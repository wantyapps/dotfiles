# About Arrow Keys in Vim

When I started learning vim, I was using a very bad keyboard. When navigating, I would often
use the arrow keys instead of `h,j,k,l`. I knew it was a bad habit, but it was too hard to
press the `h,j,k,l` keys. When moving from that computer to a laptop, I edited my vim configuration
to block all the arrow keys, and tried to live with that. It was not easy, but after some practice,
I was using the correct keys without any problems. When I moved from NeoVim to Vim, I did not even
add the lines to block the arrow keys, because I was using the proper keys. Now, I sometimes use
the arrow keys to navigate words when in Insert Mode, but rarely.
