# Leaving NeoVim Behind

You heard it right, I removed NeoVim from my computer.
Yes, the configuration files for it are still here, but I do not use it anymore.

Why?
[rwxrob](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob). He told me that NeoVim is bloat, and I finally accepted this fact.

NeoVim is bloat. Period.

I am currently using Vim to write this markdown file, and it is awesome.

I am happy with my decision.
