# I No Longer Use Emacs

Before switching from NeoVim to Vim, I used Emacs to edit LaTeX files, compile them and work with them.
I no longer use it. Like NeoVim, I used Doom Emacs. Doom Emacs is just slow and heavy.
It literally takes my computer 3 seconds to load Emacs with all of its plugins.
I will just use Vim to edit LaTeX files.
